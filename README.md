# advJAVAC
This is a coursework solution for the Module Advanced Java part of my MSc in Cloud Computing
The aim of this project is to demonstrate and implement the use of classes and interfaces as part of a Car Rental System and includes
the following:

1) appropriate overriding of Object class methods, including overriding
toString and providing a static valueOf method when appropriate

2) design of interface-based hierarchies, programming through interfaces and late
binding

3) the use of factories to control instantiation of objects, including guaranteeing the
instantiation of unique instances

4) defensive programming including the use of immutability

5) the use of appropriate interfaces and classes from the Collections framework

6) appropriate use of Javadocs to document your interfaces and classes

7) the use of testing
